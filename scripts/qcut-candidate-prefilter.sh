# qcut-candidate-prefilter.sh — implements the 3-gate q-cut prefilter (skill q1153-peak-structural-map.md).
#
# Kill a qubit-width-cut candidate on paper BEFORE any build/island compute. Pass the candidate's
# restore mechanism, the peak chunk's stage-width s, and a Toffoli-factor estimate; the tool applies
# the 3 gates (restore safety, dependency-floor, product-test) and verdicts CHASE / KILL-<gate>.
#
# Usage:
#   qcut-candidate-prefilter.sh <restore_mech> <peak_chunk_s> <toffoli_factor_vs_ripple>
#   restore_mech ∈ {exact-unitary, cond-clean-dagger, bennett, dirty-borrow, mbu-live-control, ghosting, prob-trunc}
#   peak_chunk_s = the stage-width of the chunk that sets the global peak (our peak is s=2)
#   toffoli_factor_vs_ripple = ratio of the candidate's Toffoli count to the ~8-CCX/chunk ripple
#                              (e.g. 1.0 ≈ same, 4.0 ≈ O(n log n) asymptotic adder at narrow n)
# Example:
#   qcut-candidate-prefilter.sh dirty-borrow 2 4.0   # → KILL (g1 dirty + g2 width-1 + g3 product)
#   qcut-candidate-prefilter.sh exact-unitary 6 1.0    # → CHASE (if a staircase-reshape made the peak s=6)
