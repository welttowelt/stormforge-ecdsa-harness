# Source Packet Novelty Gate

Codex-discoverable bridge to the repo-local skill:

    skills/source-packet-novelty-gate.md

Use the repo-local instructions and run:

    python3 scripts/storm-source-packet-novelty-gate.py <redacted-packet-or-summary>

Require a machine-readable packet with route_id, owner, next, frontier_score,
q-tier, source hash, candidate index/diff hash, source location, explicit
outside closed ledger novelty evidence, a bounded source-proof next step, and
no_submit_ack=yes. Exhausted source-family summaries are NACKs, not new
source packets.
