# stormgate

`stormgate` is the public-safe name for the prefilter and validation gate used
around `ecdsa.fail` island-search work.

Evidence label: `Partial run` plus `Prefilter`.

## Purpose

`stormgate` separates high-volume screening from trusted validation:

- screen candidate tails with a fast, circuit-aware prefilter,
- reject known hard failures before CPU validation,
- send only survivors to a trusted validator,
- stop validation on the first classical, phase, or ancilla failure,
- keep every scanner hit labeled `Prefilter` until official validation returns
  clean `0/0/0`.

The target shape is a GPU-friendly stage-1 predicate that can screen millions of
candidates per second, with CPU work reserved for a much smaller survivor set.

## Current Public Status

The safe public claim is narrow:

- The accepted clean canary is preserved by the current local `stormgate`
  prototype.
- The TrailMix jump-2 width/convergence screen rejects known GCD hard failures.
- The apply pseudo-Mersenne fold-risk screen rejects a subset of known dirty
  apply-path survivors.
- The apply screen is not complete yet; remaining dirty survivors still require
  trusted validation.
- A separate fused-fold heuristic was tested and rejected because it false
  rejected the accepted clean canary.
- The GPU wrapper now fail-closes if a TrailMix jump-2 state is searched with a
  non-TrailMix mode, preventing the stale state/mode mismatch that caused a
  false-negative canary path.
- A source-baked 1162q tail retake promoted at check time with score
  `1614059832` from source commit `94d44be`. `stormgate` helped the
  search/triage lane; the promoted source delta is the baked tail nonce retake.

This makes `stormgate` a useful gate, not a proof of cleanliness by itself.

## Gate Contract

Use these labels consistently:

- `stage-1 reject`: deterministic prefilter reject.
- `stage-1 survivor`: prefilter passed, still not clean.
- `validator reject`: trusted replay found classical, phase, or ancilla failure.
- `full clean`: official validation completed with `0/0/0`.

Never publish win language from a `stage-1 survivor`.

## Implementation Shape

The implementation should stay circuit-resilient:

- derive predicates from the promoted source and baked schedules,
- keep unsafe diagnostics behind explicit opt-in flags,
- require canary safety before promoting any predicate,
- reject early in validator batches while preserving simulator transcript
  semantics,
- route GPU `clean` rows back through CPU trusted validation.

## Promotion Checklist

Before a `stormgate` predicate can be treated as production:

1. It must preserve the accepted clean canary.
2. It must reject at least one documented dirty class.
3. It must not depend on private raw scan logs.
4. It must pass the public harness redaction check before publication.
5. It must keep all unresolved survivors labeled `Prefilter`.
6. It must send every score-relevant survivor to official validation before the
   submit gate opens.

## Public Boundary

Do not put private endpoints, raw ranges, local paths, raw logs, unreleased
candidate diffs, or raw tail values in public `stormgate` notes. Public artifacts
may describe the gate, evidence label, dirty class, validator class, and
redacted aggregate outcomes.
